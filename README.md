# Artado Search Rewrite

We are rewriting Artado in React and TypeScript! This repository is for the development of the **new Artado Search**.

## Why Rewrite?

Current version of Artado Search is written in ASP.NET and C#. ASP.NET is a great web framework and it fulfilled our needs so far. But ASP.NET has problems. One of the main reason we abandon ASP.NET is lack of support for cross-platform. ASP.NET doesn't really work well in other platforms except Windows. There were Mono for this job but it lacks many features and doesn't really work well. You can read [this article](https://halfblood.pro/the-end-of-mono/) for state of Mono. Another problem in ASP.NET is lack of contributions. There had been many people that wanted but couldn't contribute to Artado because of ASP.NET. Thus there have been many request to abandon the ASP.NET and rewrite the Artado Search in another language/framework.

For these reasons we decided it is best to rewrite the entire project(again). We know this process will take time but it won't be that long. We are expecting to move on to this version by the end of 2024. And the current version does its job very well, so users shouldn't have problems while using Artado.

## But why React and Typescript?

Current contributors decided that. And these technologies are really popular these days.
