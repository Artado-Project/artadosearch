Artado is open source and can show not only its own results but also the results of other search engines without ads. It works like a proxy server. You send a request to Artado and it sends an anonymous request to other search engines. Artado Search aims to provide you with ad-free and safest information. Artado Search started to be developed in May 2020 and entered the testing phase towards the end of 2020. It respects and protects users privacy, freedom and anonymity.
